# Aaswaad  Indian Restaurant - Menu 🌶️🍛

Welcome to **Aaswaad Indian Restaurant**, a vibrant and fully interactive web-based restaurant menu application! Crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project brings the rich flavors of Indian cuisine to life with a modern, user-friendly interface. 🚀

## ✨ Project Highlights

- **Extensive Menu**: Features 15+ items per category (Appetizers, Main Courses, Curries, Breads, Rice, Desserts, Water Bottles, Mocktails, Cocktails, and Additional), with Veg and Non-Veg options clearly separated.
- **Interactive Features**: Dynamic category filtering, "Add to Cart" functionality, and a scroll-to-reveal cart with real-time total in ₹.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Sleek, responsive layout with image placeholders (replace with real images for full effect!) and a sticky header.
- **Versatile Categories**: Includes unique sections like Water Bottles, Mocktails, Cocktails, and Additional items for a complete dining experience.

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Structured layout with semantic tags.
- **CSS3**: Stylish, responsive design with smooth animations.
- **JavaScript**: Real-time cart updates and interactive filtering.

## 🌟 Why This Stands Out

This project demonstrates my expertise in front-end development, UI/UX design, and problem-solving. It’s a practical solution for e-commerce or restaurant management, ideal for showcasing to employers or collaborators. The engaging design and functionality make it a portfolio gem! 🎯
